The aim of the coding challenge was to create a simple program in my choice of language.
There are some changes from the inital design i had to make which are discribed in the code aswell:
"I changed object attached from observer to employee otherwise i coulden't display role/use the update function"

i wish i could of done the optional extra however i just havent got the time as i have a 10 hour shift Sunday and a 9 Am shift Monday

The program was coded in C++ in Visual Studio.
Thanks
